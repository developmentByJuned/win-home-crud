## Description

The Dummy Web App was generated using the latest Next.js version at the time of creation, which is version 13. This app incorporates a well-organized folder structure and reusable components, offering different ways to handle various UI scenarios.

The project follows the best practices and leverages Tailwind CSS for all its stylings. While creating the project, utmost care has been taken to adhere to the standards set by the community. However, there is always room for improvement in the code, and future contributions are welcome to make it even better.

The project also takes full advantage of the latest features of Next.js, including new ways of routing, handling server-side and client-side components, and more. All components are designed to be easily connected with APIs, allowing for seamless integration or any other necessary changes through dynamically coded components.
